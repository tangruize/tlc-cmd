[options] ; TLC cmd arguments
; "target" specifies the top module TLA+ file
target: path/to/top_module.tla
; "model name" creates a directory "path/to/model_name" + "_timestamp" + "_seq", copies all tla files to it
model name: model_name
; default options are as follows (optional)

; "workers" worker numbers, default is 1. (use "auto" to automatically select the number of threads)
workers: 1
; SHOW_IN_TABLE to show in the summary table, must be used consecutively after the option
workers: SHOW_IN_TABLE
; "dfs depth" sets model checking search mode to dfs (default is bfs), and sets the search depth
dfs depth: 100
; "simulation depth" enables simulation mode and sets the search depth
simulation depth: 100
; "simulation traces" generates n*worker traces (default is infinite), also enables simulation mode
simulation traces: 0
; "simulation dump traces" saves traces, also enables simulation mode
simulation dump traces: false/true
; "simulation seed" sets seed for random simulation (can be used to reproduce an experiment), also enables simulation mode
simulation seed: 0
; "check deadlock" whether or not to check deadlock, default is false
check deadlock: false/true
; "checkpoint minute" interval between check point, default is 30
checkpoint minute: 30
; "recover" recover from the checkpoint with the specified id (i.e. path, recommended to use absolute path), default is not set
recover: /path/to/yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss.SSS
; "clean up" clean up the states directory (only when not recovering), default is false
clean up: true/false
; "gzip" controls if gzip is applied to value input/output (checkpoint) streams, default is false (true saves ~88% disk spaces)
gzip: false/true
; "dump states" saves states to "MC_states.dump" or "MC_states.dot". value range: "true", "dot", or "false" (default)
dump states: false/true/dot/dot,colorize,actionlabels,stuttering
; "coverage minute" sets tlc computing coverage every n minutes, default is disabled
coverage minute: 1
; "system memory" physical memory to use (MB)
system memory: 4000
; "memory ratio" physical memory ratio to use (0..1) (overrides "system memory")
memory ratio: 0.4
; "community modules" whether or not to use community modules, default is false
community modules: false/true
; "generate spec TE" generating a trace exploration (TE) spec, default is false
generate spec TE: false/true
; "dump trace" formats the TLA+ error trace as TLA and JSON, default is false
dump trace: false/true
; "stop after" TLC stops after n seconds
stop after: 600
; "liveness check" checks liveness properties at different times of model checking
liveness check: default/final/seqfinal
; "diff trace" when printing trace, show only the differences between successive states
diff trace: false/true
; "distributed mode" run an ad hoc TLC distributed server, the value should be hostname/ip (not true)
distributed mode: false/true/hostname/ip
; distributed worker types: "distributed TLC and fingerprint" is recommended
distributed TLC workers: user1@host1 [memory] [thread count]
                         user2@host2 [memory] [thread count]
distributed fingerprint server: user2@host2
distributed TLC and fingerprint: user3@host3

                    split by
                    line

; trace file or MC.out (with counterexample traces) to provide a state
